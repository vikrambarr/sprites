Hi!

I see you found the sprites for Digimon Showdown: Dimensional Rift :)

Digimon Showdown Dimensional Rift (DSDR) is a open source mod of Pokemon Showdown, if you intend on using these sprites in anyway such as forking our game please leave credit for the hard work.

Our Github as of writing this is here: https://github.com/DieterReinert/Digimon-Showdown-Dimensional-Rift

Also while your here don't forget to support the official Digimon products :D
